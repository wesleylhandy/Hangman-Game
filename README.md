# Hangman-Game

This game is themed on mathematical concepts inspired by the videos of the youTube channel: Numberphile (https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile).

When users guess the correct term, and only on correct answers, the page displays an embedded youTube video or playlist from Numberphile.

Play the Game by entering keystrokes on a keyboard. The only acceptable keys are a-z (for answers that are English words) and 0-9 (for answers that are some numerical constant). 

The  Start Game Button controls when a new game begins.
